In this particular assignment, a random range of numbers is created using range() function. A list of the numbers in the range can also be viewed as in list(range(0,20)) which displays values from 0 to 19 in the form of list.
Range of even numbers, odd numbers can be created by giving the step value along with the initial and final value of the range. Minnimum and maximum values in a list can also be displayed using min() or max() functions.
The difference between pop() and remove() is also analysed where pop() would remove an element using its index value whereas remove() would remove the element mentioned along parenthesis directly.
